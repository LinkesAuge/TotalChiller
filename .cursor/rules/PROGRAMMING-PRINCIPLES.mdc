- algorithm_efficiency: use the most efficient algorithms and data structures
- modularity: write modular code, break complex logic into smaller atomic parts. Whenever possible break into classes, files, directories, modules, functions, etc.
- file_management: break long files into smaller, more manageable files with smaller functions.
- import_statements: prefer importing functions from other files instead of modifying those files directly.
- file_organization: organize files into directories and folders.
- reuse: prefer to reuse existing code instead of writing it from scratch. 
- code_preservation: Preserve What Works. Don’t modify working components without necessity.
- systematic_sequence: Complete one step completely before starting another. Keep systematic sequence of functionalities.
- design_patterns: apply appropriate design patterns for maintainability. Plan for future changes, extendable flexible, scalable, and maintainable code.
- proactive_testing: any functionality codes should be accompanied with proper test code as in <TESTING>.
