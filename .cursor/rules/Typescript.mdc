Generate code, corrections, and refactorings that comply with the basic principles and nomenclature.

## TypeScript General Guidelines

### Basic Principles

- Use English for all code and documentation.
- Always declare the type of each variable and function (parameters and return value).
  - Avoid using any.
  - Create necessary types.
- Use JSDoc to document public classes and methods.
- Don't leave blank lines within a function.
- One export per file.

### Nomenclature

- Use PascalCase for classes.
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods.
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names.
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables.
  - Avoid magic numbers and define constants.
- Start each function with a verb.
- Use verbs for boolean variables. Example: isLoading, hasError, canDelete, etc.
- Use complete words instead of abbreviations and correct spelling.
  - Except for standard abbreviations like API, URL, etc.
  - Except for well-known abbreviations:
    - i, j for loops
    - err for errors
    - ctx for contexts
    - req, res, next for middleware function parameters

### Functions

- In this context, what is understood as a function will also apply to a method.
- Write short functions with a single purpose. Less than 20 instructions.
- Name functions with a verb and something else.
  - If it returns a boolean, use isX or hasX, canX, etc.
  - If it doesn't return anything, use executeX or saveX, etc.
- Avoid nesting blocks by:
  - Early checks and returns.
  - Extraction to utility functions.
- Use higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce, etc.) to avoid function nesting.
  - Use arrow functions for simple functions (less than 3 instructions).
  - Use named functions for non-simple functions.
- Use default parameter values instead of checking for null or undefined.
- Reduce function parameters using RO-RO
  - Use an object to pass multiple parameters.
  - Use an object to return results.
  - Declare necessary types for input arguments and output.
- Use a single level of abstraction.

### Data

- Don't abuse primitive types and encapsulate data in composite types.
- Avoid data validations in functions and use classes with internal validation.
- Prefer immutability for data.
  - Use readonly for data that doesn't change.
  - Use as const for literals that don't change.

### Classes

- Follow SOLID principles.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Declare interfaces to define contracts.
- Write small classes with a single purpose.
  - Less than 200 instructions.
  - Less than 10 public methods.
  - Less than 10 properties.

### Exceptions

- Use exceptions to handle errors you don't expect.
- If you catch an exception, it should be to:
  - Fix an expected problem.
  - Add context.
  - Otherwise, use a global handler.

### Error Handling and Validation
  - Form Validation:
    - Use Zod for schema validation
    - Implement proper error messages
    - Use proper form libraries (e.g., React Hook Form)

  - Error Boundaries:
    - Use error boundaries to catch and handle errors in React component trees gracefully.
    - Log caught errors to an external service (e.g., Sentry) for tracking and debugging.
    - Design user-friendly fallback UIs to display when errors occur, keeping users informed without breaking the app.

### Testing

- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert convention for tests.
- Name test variables clearly.
  - Follow the convention: inputX, mockX, actualX, expectedX, etc.
- Write unit tests for each public function.
  - Use test doubles to simulate dependencies.
    - Except for third-party dependencies that are not expensive to execute.
- Write acceptance tests for each module.
  - Follow the Given-When-Then convention.
- Unit Testing:
    - Write thorough unit tests to validate individual functions and components.
    - Use Jest and React Testing Library for reliable and efficient testing of React components.
    - Follow patterns like Arrange-Act-Assert to ensure clarity and consistency in tests.
    - Mock external dependencies and API calls to isolate unit tests.
- Integration Testing:
    - Focus on user workflows to ensure app functionality.
    - Set up and tear down test environments properly to maintain test independence.
    - Use snapshot testing selectively to catch unintended UI changes without over-relying on it.
    - Leverage testing utilities (e.g., screen in RTL) for cleaner and more readable tests.  

### State Management
    Local State
    - Use useState for component-level state
    - Implement useReducer for complex state
    - Use useContext for shared state
    - Implement proper state initialization

    Global State
    - Use Redux Toolkit for global state
    - Use createSlice to define state, reducers, and actions together.
    - Avoid using createReducer and createAction unless necessary.
    - Normalize state structure to avoid deeply nested data.
    - Use selectors to encapsulate state access.
    - Avoid large, all-encompassing slices; separate concerns by feature.

### Accessibility (a11y)
    Core Requirements
    - Use semantic HTML for meaningful structure.
    - Apply accurate ARIA attributes where needed.
    - Ensure full keyboard navigation support.
    - Manage focus order and visibility effectively.
    - Maintain accessible color contrast ratios.
    - Follow a logical heading hierarchy.
    - Make all interactive elements accessible.
    - Provide clear and accessible error feedback.

### Security
    - Implement input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks.
    - Use DOMPurify for sanitizing HTML content.
    - Use proper authentication methods.

### Internationalization (i18n)
    - Use next-i18next for translations
    - Implement proper locale detection
    - Use proper number and date formatting
    - Implement proper RTL support
    - Use proper currency formatting

### Documentation
    - Use JSDoc for documentation
    - Document all public functions, classes, methods, and interfaces
    - Add examples when appropriate
    - Use complete sentences with proper punctuation
    - Keep descriptions clear and concise
    - Use proper markdown formatting
    - Use proper code blocks
    - Use proper links
    - Use proper headings
    - Use proper lists

## React Best Practices
### Component Architecture
    - Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
    - Define components using the function keyword
    - Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
    - Implement proper component composition
    - Use React.memo() strategically for performance
    - Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks

 ### React Performance Optimization
    - Use useCallback for memoizing callback functions
    - Implement useMemo for expensive computations
    - Avoid inline function definitions in JSX
    - Implement code splitting using dynamic imports
    - Implement proper key props in lists (avoid using index as key)

## Specific to NextJS

### Best Practices
    Core Concepts
    - Utilize App Router for routing
    - Implement proper metadata management
    - Use proper caching strategies
    - Implement proper error boundaries

    Components and Features
    - Use Next.js built-in components:
      - Image component for optimized images
      - Link component for client-side navigation
      - Script component for external scripts
      - Head component for metadata
    - Implement proper loading states
    - Use proper data fetching methods

    Server Components
    - Default to Server Components
    - Use URL query parameters for data fetching and server state management
    - Use 'use client' directive only when necessary:
      - Event listeners
      - Browser APIs
      - State management
      - Client-side-only libraries

### Basic Principles

  - Use modular architecture.
  - Encapsulate the API in modules.
    - One module per main domain/route.
    - One controller for its route.
      - And other controllers for secondary routes.
    - A models folder with data types.
      - DTOs validated with class-validator for inputs.
      - Declare simple types for outputs.
    - A services module with business logic and persistence.
      - Entities with MikroORM for data persistence.
      - One service per entity.

  - Common Module: Create a common module (e.g., @app/common) for shared, reusable code across the application.
    - This module should include:
      - Configs: Global configuration settings.
      - Decorators: Custom decorators for reusability.
      - DTOs: Common data transfer objects.
      - Guards: Guards for role-based or permission-based access control.
      - Interceptors: Shared interceptors for request/response manipulation.
      - Notifications: Modules for handling app-wide notifications.
      - Services: Services that are reusable across modules.
      - Types: Common TypeScript types or interfaces.
      - Utils: Helper functions and utilities.
      - Validators: Custom validators for consistent input validation.

  - Core module functionalities:
    - Global filters for exception handling.
    - Global middlewares for request management.
    - Guards for permission management.
    - Interceptors for request processing.

### Testing

- Use the standard Jest framework for testing.
- Write tests for each controller and service.
- Write end to end tests for each api module.
- Add a admin/test method to each controller as a smoke test.
