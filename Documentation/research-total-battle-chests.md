## 1. How Chests Work

- Chests appear in the **Gifts tab** of the Clan menu.
- Players have **20 hours** to open a chest before it expires and must be deleted.
- Opening chests contributes to **Clan Wealth** (see Wealth Chests below).
- The "Quest for Chests" regular tournament awards points for opening Clan chests, Crypt chests, and purchase chests.

| Level | Quality Tier | Notes                                 |
| ----- | ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Lowest       | Base wealth reward                    |
| 2     |              |                                       |
| 3     |              |                                       |
| 4     |              |                                       |
| 5     |              |                                       |
| 6     | Highest      | Maximum wealth = all 6 levels awarded |

> At maximum wealth, members receive **six chests — one of each quality level**. The reward includes the chest for that level plus all previous levels.
>
> **Note:** Specific in-game names for each wealth chest level were not found in public sources. They likely follow a quality-tier naming convention (e.g., Common → Legendary).

## 6. Data Structure (for Implementation)

Based on the TBChestTracker project, each chest record has:

```
ChestType     — Category: "Arena" | "Common" | "Rare" | "Epic" | "Citadel" | "Event" | "Purchase" | "Monster" | "Tournament" | "Wealth"
ChestName     — Display name: e.g., "Harpy Chest", "Elven Citadel Chest"
HasLevel      — Boolean: whether the chest has a level (Crypts/Citadels = true, Arena = false)
MinLevel      — Minimum source level (e.g., 5 for Common, 10 for Rare, 15 for Epic)
MaxLevel      — Maximum source level (e.g., 35 for most Crypts, 30 for Citadels)
IncrementPerLevel — Level step (typically 5)
```

---

## 7. Chest Icons

Chest icons were **not available** in any public documentation or wiki. The game uses unique themed artwork for each chest (matching the chest name — e.g., "Cobra Chest" has a cobra-themed design). Options for obtaining icons:

1. **In-game screenshots** — Capture each chest appearance from the Gifts tab.
2. **Game asset extraction** — The game client may contain chest icon assets (legal considerations apply).
3. **Community contribution** — Request clan members or community to screenshot/share chest icons.
4. **Custom artwork** — Commission or create themed chest icons matching the naming conventions.
