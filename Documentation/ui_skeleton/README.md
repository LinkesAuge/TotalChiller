# UI Skeleton Preview

Open any HTML file in this folder directly in a browser to preview the style:
- `index.html`
- `dashboard.html`
- `news.html`
- `data-import.html`
- `data-table.html`
- `admin.html`
- `auth-login.html`
- `auth-register.html`
- `auth-forgot.html`
- `components.html`
- `charts.html`
- `events.html`
- `messaging.html`

All pages use `styles.css`, which is based on the dark blue and gold theme tokens.

## Status Notes
- Skeleton files are static references and may lag behind the current app.
- Current app includes Validation + Corrections admin sections, and updated data import filtering/sorting.
